# What is MLOps?

Before understanding MLOps, it’s important to understand **where it comes from**.

MLOps is **directly inspired by DevOps**.

Just like DevOps transformed how we build and operate software, **MLOps brings those same principles into the Machine Learning world**.

## How DevOps Inspired MLOps

### What DevOps Solved

Before DevOps:
- Developers wrote code
- Ops teams deployed and maintained it
- Deployments were slow, manual, and risky
- Failures were hard to debug

DevOps introduced:
- Automation
- CI/CD pipelines
- Infrastructure as Code
- Monitoring and feedback loops
- Shared ownership between Dev and Ops

The result:
- Faster releases
- More reliable systems
- Continuous improvement

## The Same Problem Happened in Machine Learning

In ML, a similar gap appeared:

- Data Scientists trained models in notebooks
- Models worked locally
- Production teams struggled to deploy them
- No clear ownership after deployment
- Models degraded silently over time

Just like Dev vs Ops, ML had a gap between:
- **Model development**
- **Model operations**

That gap is what **MLOps** was created to solve.

## MLOps = DevOps Practices for Machine Learning

MLOps takes proven DevOps ideas and applies them to ML systems.

| DevOps Concept | MLOps Equivalent |
|----------------|------------------|
| Source code versioning | Data + model versioning |
| CI pipelines | Model training pipelines |
| CD pipelines | Automated model deployment |
| Monitoring services | Monitoring model performance |
| Rollbacks | Model version rollback |
| Automation | End-to-end ML lifecycle automation |
