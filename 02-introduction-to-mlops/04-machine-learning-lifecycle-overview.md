# Machine Learning Lifecycle

The Machine Learning lifecycle is the complete journey of building, deploying, and maintaining an ML model.
It covers everything from collecting raw data to monitoring the model in production.

Below is a clear step-by-step breakdown:

### Problem Definition

Understand what problem you are solving.

Define the goal: classification, regression, clustering, etc.

Identify what a good outcome looks like (accuracy, latency, cost).

### Data Collection

Gather raw data from various sources: databases, APIs, logs, sensors, user inputs, etc.

Ensure the data represents real-world scenarios.

### Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handle missing values.

Remove noise and duplicates.

Fix incorrect or inconsistent entries.

Split the data into train/validation/test sets.

This is usually the most time-consuming step.

### Feature Engineering

Transform raw data into meaningful features.

Examples: converting timestamps, extracting text embeddings, scaling numbers, one-hot encoding categories.

Better features → better model performance.

### Model Selection

Choose the right algorithm based on the problem and data:

Linear Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting

Neural Networks

etc.

### Model Training

Feed training data into the algorithm.

The model learns patterns and relationships.

Adjust parameters to minimize the error.

### Model Evaluation

Test model performance on validation/test datasets.

Common metrics: Accuracy, F1-score, RMSE, ROC-AUC.

Check if the model meets the defined success criteria.

### Hyperparameter Tuning

Improve performance using techniques like Grid Search, Random Search, Bayesian Optimization.

Examples: learning rate, depth of trees, regularization values.

### Model Deployment

Move the model from development to production.

Deployment options:

REST API

Batch jobs

Edge devices

Cloud ML services (SageMaker, Vertex AI, etc.)

### Monitoring & Logging

Monitor model accuracy, drift, latency, errors.

Track data distribution and real-world performance.

Set alerts for anomalies or performance drops.

### Model Maintenance

Retrain with new data.

Update the pipeline when business logic or data changes.

Version control for data, code, and models.
